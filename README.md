Collection of Python functions for working with oceanography data processing and analysis.

Maintained by the Oceanography section at the [Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.npolar.no/en/).

The idea is more in-house specific things can live here, but more truly general stuff can live in [kval](github.com/NPIOcean/kval)

Example of things to p√•ut here:

- Parsers for specific file formats.
- NPI-specific metadata fixing.
- Log sheets, excel sheets and associated parsers or converterts.
